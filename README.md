Image categorization 

In this project, we employ two different datasets: "f-minist," satellite images, and blood smears. Additionally, we utilize three distinct categorization techniques: regular neural networks, self-organizing maps, and convolutional neural networks. You can explore the results of these codes in the following blog posts:
